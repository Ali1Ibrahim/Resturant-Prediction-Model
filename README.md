Project Overview: Restaurant Success Prediction Using Zomato Dataset

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the success of restaurants based on various features such as customer ratings, location, cost, and type of service. Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps I performed:

Data Handling :

-Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed unnecessary columns, and standardized features for uniformity. Processed the rate column by extracting numeric values and converting them into a binary classification (e.g., success based on thresholds).

-Feature Engineering: Created new features such as success indicators and performed encoding for categorical variables like restaurant types and locations.

-Data Scaling: Applied normalization techniques to ensure consistent scales for features affecting model performance.

Visualization and Statistical Analysis

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Generated detailed visualizations to uncover trends, relationships, and outliers.
Used histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to analyze features such as cost distribution and customer rating trends.

-Correlations: Used heatmaps to identify relationships between variables, highlighting key predictors.

-Statistical Summaries: Provided insights using descriptive statistics, such as means, medians, and standard deviations, to understand data distributions.

Model Training

-Pipeline Design: Implemented a clean, reusable pipeline for pre-processing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

-Model Selection: Evaluated multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression).


-Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize the model for the best performance metrics.

-Cross-Validation: Applied k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model performance and reduce overfitting risks.

-Final Deliverables

An accurate classification model to predict restaurant success, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluated.
Insights and visualizations presented in an easy-to-understand format for stakeholders.
A well-documented notebook showcasing each step in the workflow.
